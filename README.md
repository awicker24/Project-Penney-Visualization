# Project-Penney-Visualization

to do:
* save plots as HTML and PNG (separate function for each format?)
* sample size in titles
* how the numbers are displayed (98 for 98%)
* ordering of plots - which one goes on left/right, where the diagonal is, how the sequences are ordered ("x"/"y" axes), color/font choices
* presenting each vis one at a time

done:
* indicate scoring by cards or by tricks in title
* plotting libraries to use (plotly)
