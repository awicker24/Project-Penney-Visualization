# Project-Penney-Visualization

* save plots as HTML and PNG (separate function for each format?)
* sample size in titles
* plotting libraries to use (i think we decided on plotly)
* ordering of plots - which one goes on left/right, where the diagonal is, how the sequences are ordered ("x"/"y" axes), color/font choices
* presenting each vis one at a time
